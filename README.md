# ScriptScrutinize

## Features

1. Code Submissions are working
2. A submission page can be seen by all the users.
3. Individual submissions can be seen

## Info

1. The Project is using PostgreSQL instead of MySQL, as there are no deployment options for MySQL ( if avaliable are paid ). But, built it initially using MySQL.
2. The Database is deployed on Reder ( maybe it will take time to load the first time )
3. Submitted code are stored on server, so maybe deleted after a while. ( as the limit is on the services )
